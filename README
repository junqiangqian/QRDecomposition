== QR Decomposition and Eigenvalue/Eigenvector Solver for symmetric matrices ==
                           by Junqiang Qian

1) To compile the program, use the Makefile provided by entering "make" on the
   terminal.
2) The program is called qr, you can either use no arguments (i.e. just return
   "./qr") or use one argument ("./qr FILE_NAME") into the terminal.
  A) No arguments: The program will generate a random symmetric matrix of
     random dimensions (between 2 to 11 as default) containing random doubles
     varying from -MAX_RAND to MAX_RAND.
  B) One argument: The program will use the .txt file specified as the argument
     to transform that into a matrix. The text file MUST take the following
     format:

       i) Each element in a row is separated by spaces
       ii) Each row is separated by a new line
    NB : See test_matrices/valid folder for examples of valid files that can be parsed into matrices. Note that the matrix must be symmetrical otherwise an
    error will be thrown.
3) The program will write the eigenvalues/eigenvector pairs in a text file
   called results.txt. Note that this file is overwritten if a new matrix is
   generated.
4) Call make clean to clear up the directory and remove the results.txt file.

A note about the constants in QR.cpp:
  1) MAX_DIMENSION alters the maximum dimension of the matrix generated, given
     MAX_DIMENSION = x, then a matrix of dimension between 2 and (x + 1) will be
     generated.
  2) ITERATION_MAX is the maximum number of iterations the QR iteration will do
     before terminating.
  3) THRESHOLD is the maximum difference between elements at the same position
     in two consecutive iterations of the eigenvalue matrices (e.g. first
     iteration with second iteration, fifth with sixth iteration, etc), the smaller the threshold, the more iterations will be performed (but the
     program will stop once it reaches ITERATION_MAX regardless if the
     threshold is met).

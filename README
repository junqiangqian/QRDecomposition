== QR Decomposition and Eigenvalue/Eigenvector Solver for symmetric matrices ==
                           by Junqiang Qian

1) To compile the program, use the Makefile provided by entering "make" on the
   terminal.
2) The program is called qr, you can either use no arguments (i.e. just return
   "./qr") or use one argument ("./qr FILE_NAME") into the terminal.
  A) No arguments: The program will generate a random symmetric matrix of
     random dimensions (between 2 to 12 as default) containing random doubles
     varying from -MAX_RAND to MAX_RAND.
  B) One argument: The program will use the .txt file specified as the argument
     to transform that into a matrix. The text file MUST take the following
     format:

       i) Each element in a row is separated by spaces
       ii) Each row is separated by a new line
    NB : See test_matrices/valid folder for examples of valid files that can be parsed into matrices. Note that the matrix must be symmetrical otherwise an
    error will be thrown.
